Hi there! I'm **Oluwadurotimi Bajomo (Timmy)** üëã

[cite_start]I'm an experienced **DevSecOps / DevOps Engineer** and an AWS Certified professional, bringing **6+ years in IT** and **2+ years** of specialized experience in cloud infrastructure, automation, and security[cite: 36]. My mission is to build, automate, and secure highly scalable cloud environments.

[cite_start]I have a proven track record of driving significant results, including **reducing infrastructure costs by over 80% YoY** [cite: 41] [cite_start]and **decreasing production security incidents by 70%** [cite: 59] by integrating security into the CI/CD lifecycle.
